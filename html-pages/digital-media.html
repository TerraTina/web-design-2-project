        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>The year is 11945: humanity has fled to the moon after an alien attack and has created androids to fight a proxy war to reclaim earth. Aliens retaliate with their own machine life-form army, but neither win. The two fight for so long that human cities become overgrown ruins.</p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>The game is played from the perspective of androids, and this is often used to explain game mechanics. Androids have access to a network in which their data can be stored and uploaded into new bodies. Network connection also explains why the machines life-forms have access to knowledge that would otherwise be inaccessible to an individual with limited experience.</p>
        <p>However, while technology is at the heart of this story, it's used as a lens to examine the human experience. This future takes a bleak delve into existentialism, where robots contemplate the meaning of life when it becomes clear that existence is inherently meaningless.</p>

        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>In my opinion, I think this game is best experienced without knowing anything about it beforehand so if you haven't already, I encourage you to pick it up or watch someone else play it. That being said though, I will include a summary here anyways. Our playable character is an alien from a different solar system who travels in a tiny, rickety spaceship. We are trapped in a 22-minute loop, at the end of which the solar system's star explodes. The game ends when the player breaks the cycle in some fashion. There are multiple endings to the story which dependent on how the player ends the cycle.</p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p><i>Outer Wilds</i> is a game about exploration, making observations about the worlds you find yourself in, and piecing together the story of another alien species called the Nomai who had once inhabited the solar system. The game presents an intricate mystery to the player, one which ties the Nomai disappearance, the strange physics of the worlds you explore, and the time loop.</p>
        <p>In many ways, this game is also about coming to terms with and facing death. For the player character, death is innevitable and its symbol is the supernova. No matter what the player does, the supernova can't be stoped and even if the player manages to escape it, they find themselves unable to live without the solar system. In fact, it's not just the player character that is dying, as we uncover the mystery we discover that every solar system is going supernova. The player character just happens to be living at the end of the universe's lifespan. Control of the plot's apocalyptic outcome is wrested from the player, where in many games we are given that control. I think this is one of the many ways the game encourages us to think about death.</p>

        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>For the story's protagonist, linguist Louise Bank's, time is experienced in a circular fashion. Events which happen in the future also equally happened in the past. The movie begins with two inciting incidents: first, Louise grieves her daughter’s untimely death and second, twelve alien ships descend to earth and land in scattered positions around the globe. Louise is recruited by the US military as their lead linguist, so that she may learn to communicate with these aliens (heptapods). She is accompanied by the physicist Ian, and together they work to understand why heptapods have come to earth in learning their palindromic language. It is through learning this language that Louise is able to experience time circularly.</p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p><i>Arrival</i> is a film that explores how language and trauma change our perception of time. Unlike any sci-fi media that I’ve seen, language is the means by which our main character, Louise, travels through time. During these flashbacks/flashforwards, she experiences grief for events that haven’t happened yet as if they were intrusive memories. By learning an alien language, she begins to think of time as circular. She sees that the future changes the past as much as the past changes the future. But while her time travel is clearly demonstrated to be literal, it is also used to describe how we process trauma in a similarly non-linear fashion.</p>
        <p><q>There’s nothing you could’ve done</q> is one of the common phrases we use to comfort the grieving. I bring it up now because it succinctly ties the film’s themes of language, grief, time, and determinism I bring it up now because I believe it’s an interesting example of how we use language to address grief by reframing our sense of free will and time. It implies that everything happens deterministically rather than as the direct consequence of chosen actions. This is very similar to how Louise thinks of time deterministically.</p>
